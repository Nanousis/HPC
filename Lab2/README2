In order to compile and run the parallelized version with Open MP change the Makefile.

Build Sequential region with "make seq" command.
Build Parallel region with "make par" command.

Then to test the Sequential version run:
./seq_main -o -b -n 2000 -i Image_data/texture17695.bin
To test the Parallel version run:
./par_main -o -b -n 2000 -i Image_data/texture17695.bin

You can change the number of threads with 
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=X 
where X is the number of threads you want to use.
